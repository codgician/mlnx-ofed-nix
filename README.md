**Work in progress, packages are untested and may actually NOT WORK**

A small subset of Mellanox OFED packages ported to NixOS.

Further docs will be available when the code is actually usable. Everything is subject to change.

To run a REPL and inspect everything this flake provides, simply run:

```bash
nix develop
```
